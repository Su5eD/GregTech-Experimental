    "Redstone Circuits are the main Component of a well running Base. The GregTech Redstone Circuit Block is ideal for processing Logic. It can compute everything! From a simple and consistent Timer to the Combo Lock on your Door!",
    "It has a very simple interface. You just need to push as few Buttons, and you are good to go. Just don't forget to push the Start-Button right under the Energy Flow Button, after you adjusted your Configuration.",
    "Every Redstone Circuit has a different Energy consumption. Yes, running this Device needs Energy, as indicated by the small blinking Lightning Bolt on the Screen. The needed Energy is just one Energy Unit per outputted Redstone Pulse.",
    "To switch between different Redstone Circuits, just push the Button under the start Button. It looks like two sidewards pointing Arrows. The Lightning Bolt Button causes the Machine to output its Energy to the Block on its output Side.",
    "The four Buttons on the Left are controlling the System Parameters of the Redstone Circuit. You only need to right/left click them to adjust the Value. If you have an ItemStack in your Hand, then it copies a special Value into the selected Parameter.",
    "If you have something like an AND-Gate, and need to limit the Inputs for that, just place a Redstone preventing Cover on that Side. Any Cover will work, but since you need to power the Block from one Side you should use a special Cover for that.",
    "Said special Cover is the Redstone Preventer Cover, which can be attached by clicking twice with a Screwdriver on a Machine. That Cover looks Red and lets everything go through except Redstone Signals.",
    "It is always a good Idea to leave one Meter space between Circuits (that doesn't lose RS Strength), unless you directly connect the Output of a Circuit Block to the Input of another."
