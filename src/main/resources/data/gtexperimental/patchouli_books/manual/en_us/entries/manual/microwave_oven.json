    "You just got a Microwave Oven and asked yourself 'why do I even need it?'. It's simple, the Microwave can cook for just 100 EU and at an insane speed. Not even a normal E-furnace can do it that fast and cheap!",
    "This is the cheapest and fastest way to cook for you. That is why the Microwave Oven can be found in almost every Kitchen (see $(l:https://youwannabuyakitchen.ly)youwannabuyakitchen.ly$(/l)).",
    "Long time exposure to Microwaves can cause Cancer, but we doubt Steve lives long enough to die because of that.",
    "Do not dry Animals with it. It will result in a Hot Dog, no matter which Animal you put into it.",
    "Do not insert inflammable Objects. The Oven will catch on Fire.",
    "Do not insert Eggs. Just don't."
